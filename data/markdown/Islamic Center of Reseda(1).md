### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The purpose of Islamic Center of Reseda is to carry out religious, educational and other community activities in conformity with the religion of Islam; to do everything necessary, suitable and proper for the accomplishment of these objectives, within the local, State and Federal laws and practices. It is one of the largest mosques in the San Fernando Valley and was established in 1998 by Afghan immigrant families who wanted a place to teach children their Muslim heritage. Its members now originate from all parts of the world, from the Middle East to Asia, Africa and Europe, along with a sizable contingent born in the U.S. The Islamic Center is not only a place of worship, but also hosts events to feed the homeless and mentor the youth, as well as various educational classes and community get-togethers, so that members of the congregation can practice mercy, compassion and other virtues.
