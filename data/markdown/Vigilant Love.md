Description Blurb
Vigilant Love is a grassroots organization challenging Islamophobia and white supremacy in Southern California and beyond. Vigilant Love started as a coalition founded upon long-standing relationships of Los Angeles-based Muslim American and Japanese American leaders and solidarity programming since 9/11. In the days after 9/11, over 300 Japanese Americans gathered in Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles to show support for all the victims and those being impacted by Islamophobic state and interpersonal violence. In that first year, Vigilant Love was engaged in rapid response to a wave of renewed Islamophobia in Southern California and across the country after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. Since being founded in 2015 by four intergenerational women and non-binary femmes, Vigilant Love has been organizing an intergenerational, multi-spiritual community of artists, grassroots organizers, healers, scholars, cultural workers, mental health professionals, and community leaders. The four intergenerational women and non-binary femmes are Kathy Masaoka (she/her), traci kato-kiriyama (they/she), Sahar Pirzada (she/her), and traci ishigo (they/she).
