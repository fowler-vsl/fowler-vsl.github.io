### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
ICUJP was founded in Los Angeles after 9/11 to support the work of faith leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, Jewish and other spiritual faiths and traditions who say “Religious Communities Must Stop Blessing War and Violence…” ICUJP’s activities promote critical examination of the costs of violence and war at home and in the world from the Faith perspective. They insist on respect for human rights, international law and the use of peaceful means in the resolution of conflicts.
