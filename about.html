    <p class="page_content"> 
      For most of its history, the story of Muslim Angelenos has been told by non-Muslim journalists, politicians, activists, and academics. 
      <i>Visual and Sonic Landscapes of Muslim Los Angeles</i> is an effort to create a public space for self-representation and self-definition for Muslim Angelenos by Muslim Angelenos. 
      A focus on community voices and ritual, music, murals, and other artworks as primary source materials defines this project. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="page_content">
      During 2022 and 2023, which marked the first phase of the <i>Visual and Sonic Landscapes of Muslims in Los Angeles</i>, 
      our team interviewed community members and collected oral histories, 
      mapped important brick and mortar sites, and conducted an initial survey of sonic and visual 
      expressions of being Muslim in LA. The project's initial stage is the result of a collaboration 
      between the Fowler Museum and UCLA's Islamic Studies program. </p>
    
      <p class="page_content">
      Through this partnership and, we hope, many future collaborations with university and community members, 
      we endeavor to increase the content represented here, to assemble a wealth of materials and create an unprecedented 
      resource and historical record. If you wish to collaborate or add or correct information, please reach out to us at
