Little Bangladesh was first established in 2010 by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and includes four-block area around 3rd Street and Alexandria Avenue in Central Los Angeles with a concentration of Bangladeshi American residents, markets, restaurants, a mosque and a gallery. Bangladeshi people came to L.A. in significant numbers starting in the 1970s. Little Bangladesh Press Club founder and leader Qazi Huda is the force behind the murals, and realized his vision of showcasing inspiring Bangladeshis and the countryâ€™s independence in 2021. He wanted to share the history, culture, and people of Bangladesh with the Bangladeshi people living in the neighborhood and Angelenos coming through from across the city. On 3rd Street and Serrano Avenue stands a mural representing the liberation of Bangladesh from East Pakistan in 1971. At the next corner (3rd Street and Hobart Ave) the exterior walls of The Bangladesh Academy features four murals of historic figures, including the founding father of Bangladesh, Mujibur Rahman; Nobel Peace prize winning author Rabindranath Tagore; and the poet of Bangladesh, Kazi Nazrul Islam.
