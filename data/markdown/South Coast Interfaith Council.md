Description Blurb
Formed in 1953, the South Coast Interfaith Council (SCIC) is the oldest and largest interfaith council in Southern California serving 35 cities in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. In 1953, the council was first established as an ecumenical council – meaning that it was an organization of only churches representing the various denominations of the Christian faith. But in 2004, with a historical vote made by the community, the council changed from an ecumenical one to an interfaith council. In 2008, Milia Islam-Majeed joined as the Executive Director. She has spoken worldwide about her interfaith work and some of her recognitions include being one of eight national recipients of the USA Network 2010 Character Unite Awards, awarded the NAACP “2011 Woman of the Year” in Long Beach, selected in 2015 as one of the “Future-50 Emerging Leaders under the age of 35” who are shaping the landscape of faith in Los Angeles by the USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture & Interreligious Council of Los Angeles. Most recently in 2017, Milia was chosen as one of 11 individuals throughout the world to be a research fellow at the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT where her research focuses on the intersection of Islam and Ethics. Today, SCIC has over 150 member faith communities and 1700 individual members. The mission of the South Coast Interfaith Council is to promote mutual understanding, respect, appreciation and cooperation among people of faith in the Greater South Bay-Harbor-Long Beach-West Orange County area through extending hospitality, offering educational opportunities, providing moral leadership, sharing in service and working for justice. SCIC organizes food pantries, interfaith dialogues, community service and an annual gala honoring interfaith pioneers.
