### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Founded by a Sufi order, the International Institute of Tolerance has been led by Imam Ashraf Carrim and his wife Athia since 2007. The institute was founded on the principle of justice and equality and its services are religious and charitable, grounded in the Islamic faith. One of the principal aims of the Institute is to integrate Muslim Americans into America’s pluralistic society and work with other faith groups and civic organizations to enhance our collective futures. The Institute offers a variety of programs; religious, educational, and social to advance the well-being of our community, including its “Feed the Homeless” program which now serves over 1,200 hot meals a month to the houseless community downtown by partnering with the Los Angeles Mission.
