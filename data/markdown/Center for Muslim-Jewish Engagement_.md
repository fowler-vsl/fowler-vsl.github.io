### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement was an institutional partnership established in December 2007 between Hebrew Union College’s Jewish Institute of Religion, the Omar Ibn Al Khattab Foundation and the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at the USC College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Housed and administered at the USC’s Center for Religion & Civic Culture, the Center was led by Dr. Reuven Firestone and made possible by funding through the Righteous Persons Foundation until it closed in 2012. The Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement was the first center of its kind with an audience consisting of Muslim and Jewish religious leaders, community organizers, academics interested in the field of Muslim-Jewish relations, lay leaders, students and congregations. Dr. Firestone is one of the foremost Jewish scholars of Islam, authoring eight books including “Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Judaism for Muslims” (2001), “Introduction to Islam for Jews” (2008) and “The Power of Dialogue” with Khalid Durran and Leonard Swidler (2018). His work served as a predecessor to “NewGound: A Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change”, where he continues to serve on the Board of Advisors.
