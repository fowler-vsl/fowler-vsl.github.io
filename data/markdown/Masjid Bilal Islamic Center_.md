### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The rich history and tradition of the Bilal community spans sixty years. Originally formed in Los Angeles during the 1950's, Masjid Bilal Islamic Center evolved from a few committed Muslims meeting in a house following the message of Elijah Muhammad into the city's oldest mainstream Islamic community. Many community members previously belonged to Muhammad's Temple of Islam #27, located at 5606 Broadway Ave, which first began to grow under the guidance of its local minister John Shabazz. His efforts led to opening the city's first Muslim school in the early 60's, which began providing private education for its youth. Since 1971, Masjid Bilal has been in South LA under the leadership of Imam Abdul-Karim Hasan and in its current location since 1973. Under his leadership, the community grew immensely and its school became the largest private African-American school in Los Angeles, attended by thousands of children, both Muslim and non-Muslim. In 1974, Imam Abdul-Karim Hasan helped establish the first Muslim Prison Ministry program in the State of California. In 2007, Imam Abdul-Karim Hasan Square was designated by L.A. Councilmember Jan Perry (MLK Blvd & Central). Community member and organizer Najee Ali also worked with Imam Hasan and City Councilmember Curren Price to establish July as Muslim American Heritage Month, first in the City of L.A. in 2014 and then in the County of L.A. in 2020. Located at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and Central Ave., the newly rebuilt mosque includes the tallest free-standing minaret in the state of California.
