### Description  {.description}
Building upon the foundations laid out by Long Beachâ€™s first mosque, Masjid Al Shariff, the Long Beach Islamic Center provides a religious and educational environment that meets the growing needs of its diverse and ever-expanding Muslim community. The LBIC was originally founded in 2004 by Sheikh Tariq Mohammed, though he and his community experienced a decade of delays, funding deficits and other setbacks.They were finally able to officially open the center at its current residence in October 2015. The prayer hall serves not only local converts and community members, but also Muslim students from Cal State Long Beach, and Muslims employed in Long Beach and its surrounding areas. The Islamic Center currently provides an open facility that hosts the five prayers on a daily basis, Friday congregational/Jumaa prayers, Eid prayers, Ramadan breakfasts and Qiyam prayers. The mosque also provides classes teaching Islam and Arabic language classes with special emphasis on new Muslims and children classes.
