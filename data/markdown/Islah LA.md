### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Islah LA emerged from the historic Masjid Ibaadillah community in South Los Angeles, founded by Imam Saddiq Saafir in 1986. Led by Imam Saadiq Saafir, a group of families purchased storefront property on West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles to establish Masjid Ibaadillah and to serve its predominantly African-American community. The Islah LA community center is a secular nonprofit charity founded in June 2013. Its primary focus is service to the greater community, including a food pantry and a supportive housing program. It also started a full-time day school called Islah Academy in 2014, offering a Muslim-school curriculum specializing in social justice, high academic standards, Quranic studies, and 21st Century leadership. Islah LA is one of the first of its kind in the United States – an inner-city community center founded by Muslim-Americans to serve South Los Angeles. They chose the Arabic word, “Islah”, because of its meaning to renew, revive, and restore. The mosque has monthly family nights, weekly jumma prayers, a youth group, food pantry and garden.
