### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Founded first as the Pasadena Altadena Dawah Center in the early 1970s by the Nation of Islam, the Muslim families it served were each invited to submit a name for consideration for the mosque once it became part of Sunni Islam. Each family submitted one of the names of God for consideration and made their case, and ultimately the name Masjid Al-Taqwa (The Mosque of the Unwavering Awareness) and began offering weekly prayer services, a co-ed youth group, a womenâ€™s group and family picnics through the 1990s. In recent decades, the community has grown increasingly diverse and has adapted to meet the needs and interests of its evolving membership.
