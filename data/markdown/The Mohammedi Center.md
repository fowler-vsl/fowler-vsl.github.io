### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
More than 160 families worship at the Ezzi masjid in Woodland Hills, which was inaugurated by His Holiness Dr. Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin in 2015. Although the $6.5 million Mohammedi Center has been open for years, Muslim families have been unable to pray inside its 18,000-square-foot masjid—which is designed to stand for 1,000 years—until Saifuddin’s visit. Its master builder was Shabbir Saifee, a former Hughes Aircraft engineer, who constructed what some believe to be the finest Fatimi-style mosque in the nation.The Dawoodi Bohra, who trace their roots to the Fatimid Caliphate that once spanned the Arab world, now number a million members worldwide. Known for its religious tolerance of other faiths, the Shi’a sect also values education, medicine, philanthropy and preservation of ancient landmarks across the globe. With a particular focus on hard work and education, most American Dawoodi Bohras are doctors, nurses, teachers, academics and successful business people. This includes 53 locally owned small businesses in information technology, legal, and engineering.
