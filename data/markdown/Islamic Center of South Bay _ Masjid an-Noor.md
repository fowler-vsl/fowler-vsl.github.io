### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The Islamic Center of South Bay (ICSB), also known as Masjid Al-Noor, was established in October 1982 by a group of families living in the South Bay. Prayers and initial programs were conducted at the Courtyard Mall Community Room in Rolling Hills Estates. As attendance increased, the center moved to the Torrance YMCA, and then to the Hermosa Beach Community Center. In 1985, within three years of forming, this permanent location was acquired in Lomita, and remains the current location of ICSB. Presently, ICSB facilities include a prayer hall, library, four classrooms, an office, covered patio, four bathrooms, wudu facilities, parking lot, kitchen, and encompasses about 62,000 square feet. The mosque holds weekly prayers and educational programs, Sunday School, youth group, and community gatherings.
