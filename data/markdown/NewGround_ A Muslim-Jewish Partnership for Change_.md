### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
NewGround: A Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change was launched in 2007 as a joint initiative by the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Progressive Jewish Alliance in Tom Bradley Tower at L.A. City Hall with the support of then City Councilmember Eric Garcetti (who went on to serve as Mayor from 2013-2022). NewGround provides opportunities for Muslims and Jews of all backgrounds to build honest, authentic relationships with one another, to establish a common commitment to change, and to become a new cadre of leaders who inspire hope in a troubled world. Its flagship programs are two annual fellowships – one for adults and one for high school students – that take participants through active listening and conflict mediation, Islam and Judaism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, xenophobia and invites them to collaborate on a local project of benefit to both communities and the City of L.A. To date, more than 300 people have graduated from NewGround’s programs and more than 10,000 Angelenos have attended the group’s events. Executive Director Aziza Hasan also served on President Barack Obama’s Neighborhood and Faith-Based Advisory Council and L.A. City Commissioner for Human Rights, and also gave a TEDx Women talk called “Unlocking the Courage of Curiosity.”
