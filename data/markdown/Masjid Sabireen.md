### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Masjid Sabireen was established in 1998 by the Cham American Muslim community. Cham people are an ethnic minority from Vietnam and Cambodia. The Cham American Muslim community was established in the 1980â€™s from a small community of Cham refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. Masjid Sabireen originally started with only a handful of Cham families that moved from Orange County to Pomona to be near the newly acquired Masjid. Other small Cham Muslim communities are located in Fullerton, Santa Ana, Washington, and Pennsylvania. The Cham American Muslim Community was established to provide religious services such as congressional prayer, lectures, counseling services, and support for the small Cham community who at the time did not speak or understand much English. Today, the Cham American Muslim Community manages and maintains the house of Allah with the help and support of all the local muslim brothers and sisters in the Pomona valley community. Each successive has seen the masjid with new members and a growing community from various backgrounds.
