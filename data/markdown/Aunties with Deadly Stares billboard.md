Multimedia artist, writer and organizer Taz Ahmed’s art was on display on a billboard at the corner of Normandie and Hollywood Blvds in early 2023 as part of a citywide campaign by the local non-profit The Billboard Creative. Ahmed’s work, “The Aunties with Deadly Stare,” showcases her signature style and creativity as a visual artist. The group aims to make art accessible to Angelenos by placing the art of underrepresented artists at the forefront of the public urban environment of LA: the busiest traffic intersections. Ahmed is a prolific multimedia artist who co-hosted the award-winning #GoodMuslimBadMuslim podcast for five seasons, has produced annual #MuslimVDay cards featuring 6 postcards featuring witty counterculture messages fused with tidbits from Muslim culture.
