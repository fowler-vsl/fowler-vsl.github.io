### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Angelenos Yousef Hilmy (Minaret Records) and Ibrahim Mimou (OPENISM), the collaborators behind Salafi Cowboy, turned to the medium of street art in 2016 to help convey a simple spiritual message: "Earth is a mosque." They recruited their friends, Erick Medel and ­Gabriela ­Romano, to design and produce a stencil that ­features an emblem of the Kaaba. An arrow, with the words "Qibla Here", and the hashtag ­#EarthisaMosque are also stamped on the design. They hand-cut a prototype stencil out of cardboard, and a pavement in downtown Santa Monica became the first to receive the sidewalk art in December 2018. "Most sidewalk graffiti we have seen is commercial,” they’ve said in press interviews, confirming that the arrows do in fact point toward the direction of the Kaaba in Saudi Arabia, where Muslims worldwide face for their ritual prayers. “We wanted to contribute something more pointed and functional to this ongoing visual conversation.” (Source: )
