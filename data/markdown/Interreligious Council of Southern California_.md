The Interreligious Council of Southern California (ICSOCAL) is a unique model of interreligious cooperation and collaboration made possible by the rich and diverse population of the region. Founded in 1969 as a conventional interfaith coalition of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews, it welcomed the membership of the Muslim community in the early 1970s. Today the Interreligious Council fulfills the promise of its name with the participation of all of the major religions of the world and is comprised of members from the Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, and Baha'i faith traditions.Official delegates of the member organizations take part in the planning, decision making, and implementation of all programs of the Council.
