### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Founded in the late 1950s, @UCLA’s Islamic Studies Program is the first in the Americas. In 1952, a committee of UCLA scholars was formed to establish a center for the study of the Near East, after President-Elect Dwight Eisenhower noted the strategic value of the Middle East. In 1957, the arrival of the widely-respected Austrian academic Gustave von Grunebaum established UCLA as a premiere venue for the study of Islam. The university began offering the degree of Master of Arts in Islamic Studies, and it granted its first PhD in Islamic Studies in 1961. Thanks to the leading faculty and world-class library collection, UCLA Islamic Studies quickly became one of the pre-eminent programs in
the world. Unfortunately, due to funding and administrative challenges in the 1980s, the program declined and was nearly shut down. When Professor Asma Sayeed arrived in 2012, she relished the challenge to revitalize Islamic Studies at UCLA and to chart a new course for the program, with more emphasis on undergraduate teaching and community partnerships. She launched the “Islam in the West” course and the freshman cluster “Global Islam,” which offer opportunities for undergrads to gain core literacy on both Islam and Muslims. The program currently has nearly 25 affiliated faculty across the Humanities, Social Sciences, in the Law School. In 2021, Sayeed also launched the Community Bridges Residency at UCLA to host civic leaders who are engaged with Muslims and to support their creative endeavors.
