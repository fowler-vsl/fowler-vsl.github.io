### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Twenty-five years ago, New Horizon School pioneered a new trail in the history of Islamic education by setting excellence in both academics and religious education as the primary goal, built on the foundation of a strong American Muslim identity which is rooted in knowledge, pride and service. It was the first Muslim school in the country to receive national recognition as a Blue Ribbon School in the 1990s, an award that was received by Dr. Necva Ozgur and her successor Amira Alsarraf at the Department of Education. New Horizon is well established with a highly qualified, caring, and stable faculty which seeks to address the needs of their students, recognizing their special qualities and tapping into their varied interests and talents. Educational activities provide the additional focus on arts, technology, leadership, and service learning, in our effort to educate hearts and minds. In the 2010s, New Horizon was awarded a grant by Nickelodeon Network to support the creation of its Peace Garden located on the middle school campus. New Horizon Pasadena is one of four New Horizon School campuses, with the other locations in Koreatown, West LA, and Irvine. It was founded with the vision and generous support of the Aldeen Foundation, launched by Dr. Omar and Ezmeralda Alfi along with the Bureau of Islamic and Arabic Education to create high quality educational materials for Muslim American students.
