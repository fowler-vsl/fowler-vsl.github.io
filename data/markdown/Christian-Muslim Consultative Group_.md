### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Created in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the need for understanding, the Christian-Muslim Consultative Group (CMCG) worked in partnership with leaders of various streams of Southern California Christian and Muslim communities to enhance mutual understanding, respect, appreciation, and support of the Sacred in each other. For more than 15 years under the shared leadership of Rev. Dr. Gwynne Guibord (The Guibord Center - Religion Inside Out) and Imam Dr. Jihad Turk (Bayan Islamic Graduate School & Islamic Center of Southern California), the CMCG promoted learning, dialogue and advocacy among its representative members and our wider communities of faith through lectures, workshops, press releases, youth gatherings, and other activities. One of their signature programs was Standing Together, a mosque-church member dialogue program that became a national model for interfaith relationship-building.
