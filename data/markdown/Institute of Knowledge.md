### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The Institute of Knowledge, founded in 1998, is a hybrid mosque/seminary which offers integrated primary through secondary school, higher Islamic learning (highschool and above), counseling, and chaplaincy. They aim to foster youthful Muslim minds through an integrated education in traditional religious and contemporary academic sciences. They have certificates in Islamic Studies and Arabic and a variety of courses on theology, creed, Qur'anic studies, hadīth studies, Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), spirituality, and history. They state, “Our vision is to inspire students in achieving excellence in both dimensions of knowledge; religious and academic, enabling them to become relevant, spiritual and scholarly leaders (Alims) and professionals who embody an upright and noble character.” The Institute also sponsors chaplains to serve the Muslim students at local universities, including UCLA and UC Irvine.
