### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Ahlul-Beyt Mosque, established in 1985, is a nonprofit Islamic Center corporation dedicated exclusively for religious purposes and is run primarily on a voluntary basis. The guideline in the religious teaching is the Quran, the example of Prophet Muhammad and the teachings of his descendants, the Imams of Ahlul-Beyt (descendants of Prophet Muhammad). Founded by Shia immigrants mostly from Iraq, the small prayer hall and community center is one of the oldest mosques in L.A. County serving Shia Muslims. Following his exile from Iraq, Sayed Imam Mortadha Al-Qazwini decided to settle in Los Angeles, and went on to serve as the imam of the mosque after visiting for a series of lectures in 1985. He soon encouraged his sons to join him in the U.S. to share the message of Islam. This resulted in the addition of Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini, who also served at Ahlul Bayt for a short-time before starting mosques in San Diego and Costa Mesa.
