At least a handful of murals depicting Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam leader turned Muslim internationalist, can be found in neighborhoods across L.A. County. South L.A. has the highest concentration, with Malcolm being featured alongside other inspiring American organizers Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President Barack Obama and Cesar Chavez. In one, Dr. King and Malcolm greet passersby on the wall at La Raquela Mini Chiquita Market (4826 S. Central Ave.). Artist Shyaan Khufu is behind another mural at Master Burger (4423 S. Western Ave.) where Dr. King and Malcolm are joined by President Obama while an artist Elliot Pinkney painted the “Community Heroes” mural in Compton with King and Malcolm alongside farmworker rights organizer Cesar Chavez (2015 E. Hatchway St., Compton). In 2020, after learning that a vandal defaced his Highland Park mural outside Cafe de Leche (5000 York Blvd.) depicting Martin Luther King Jr. with racial slurs in 2020, artist Tristan Eaton arrived with fresh paint to create a new image in response, of a smiling Malcolm X. “Public art can uplift people, give them a sense of identity, give them a sense of pride in their neighborhood,” Eaton told the L.A. Times at the time. “You can elevate a conversation and bring a message to the world on the wings of beauty that can’t be done in words or other mediums. You can take something and give it more power, more weight, just by painting a neighborhood.” (Sources: + )
