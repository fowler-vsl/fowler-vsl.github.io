### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The University of Southern California has a number of Islamic Studies programs and initiatives. Besides a wide range of Islamic studies undergraduate courses, they also offer a graduate track in “Global Islam” extending the category “global” beyond the traditional boundaries of the Middle East, Africa, South and Southeast Asia. Students are trained to integrate traditional and revisionist discourses among Muslims into a broader conversation about the meaning of Islam across space and time.This includes training in the accurate reading and critical analysis of the textual tradition of the Islamic religious sciences, in conversation with modern theories and methods. USC also holds The King Faisal Chair of Islamic Thought and Culture, established in 1976, which is the first and oldest endowed chair in Islamic Studies in the United States sponsored by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The chair’s explicit aim is the enhancement of the University's offerings and profile in Islamic and Arab Studies and is currently held by Professor Sherman A. Jackson. In 2006, USC’s Center for Religion and Civic Culture established the American Muslim Civic Leadership Institute (AMCLI) which develops and trains American Muslim leaders who are committed to civic engagement. In 2014 the USC Center for Islamic Thought, Culture and Practice (CITCAP) was established, which promotes scholarly research and community engagement on the relationship between Islam, Muslims and contemporary society, East and West. It brings the intellectual tradition of Islam, the evolving realities of modern cultural and sociopolitical life and the challenges and opportunities facing Muslims in the modern world into seminal and robust conversation.
