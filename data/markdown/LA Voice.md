### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
LA Voice is a multi-racial, multi-faith community organization that awakens people to their own power, training them to speak, act, and work together to transform our county into one that reflects the dignity of all people. All people have power and a voice. Every day LA Voice amplifies that power by uniting diverse faith voices to stand-up for what their communities need, winning changes that improve the lives of all Angelenos. Since 2000, LA Voice has developed a strong base of leaders, or community volunteers, that are striving to transform their neighborhoods. Umar Hakim, founder of Inkerij social enterprise, currently serves as the Board Chair.
