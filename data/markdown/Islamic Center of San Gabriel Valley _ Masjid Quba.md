### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The Islamic Center of San Gabriel Valley (aka Masjid Quba) grew out of community gatherings in people’s homes and garages, middle school reading rooms, and high school gymnasiums. The community began renting space in a strip mall in 1982 before purchasing the property at their current location in Rowland Heights in 1987. Formerly a Catholic church with a neighboring chicken farm and grass fields, today the building houses a library and hosts weekly health clinics in addition to other services. In the first phase, the community was gathering in a small set of buildings with adjoining courtyards. After a major construction campaign, it re-opened in 2013 with three libraries, a free clinic, a banquet hall, a chef’s kitchen, a charter school, a gym, a game room, administrative offices, and of course, musallahs (prayer rooms) are housed in this mosque.
