### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Founded in 1952, the Islamic Center of Southern California seeks to provide a space for people to embrace their Muslim and American identities as compatible and complementary. Since its earliest days, the community has sought to share the values of Islam by providing religious, educational, and recreational programs for their community and the public. It was first organized in the early 1950s in a garage on Fountain Ave in Los Angeles by, as Abed Awad, one of the early founders put it, “a group of guys who wanted to get together to pray''. It was officially incorporated in 1953 as the Moslem Association of America at Los Angeles, its original community composed mostly of immigrants and Muslim students from abroad who were attending area schools. By 1957, the Center had outgrown the garage and was moved to a site that once served a Jewish congregation at 3227 City Terrace Drive in East Los Angeles. In 1967, the name was changed to the Islamic Foundation of Southern California and was moved to a small house at 845 South St. Andrews Place. In 1977, the final name and location change took place - to the Islamic Center of Southern California at 434 S. Vermont Ave. Since its inception, the center has not only become a regional leader in the City of the Angels, but also a national trailblazer in building and promoting the American Muslim identity. Along the way, Center visionaries helped establish several notable civic, educational and charitable institutions to fulfill the American Muslim community’s growing needs, including one of the first co-ed Muslim Youth Groups in the country, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Muslim Women’s League, Islamic Information Service and the New Horizon Schools.
