### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Masjid Al-Fatiha, founded in 1998 by Rahmat and Sukatee Phyakul, was the first masjid established by the Thai-American Muslim community as a welcoming space for people from all backgrounds to learn, worship, and practice Islam together. They purchased and slowly renovated the former church, and have added intricate Thai and Asian wooden carvings that set the mosque design apart from any other in Los Angeles. The couple and their children continue to coordinate mosque activities for a diverse congregation, including Friday prayers and social gatherings amid a selection of plants native to the region in outside courtyards.
