### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
The Shia Ithna’asheri Islamic Jamaat of Los Angeles was formally inaugurated on April 25, 1981 under the leadership of Marhum Gulamabbas Dhala. With support from a few dedicated families, funds were raised to purchase a church and eventually convert it to what is today known as “Hussein Imambargah, aka Husseinia”. The Imambargah’s official inception was held on the 1400th birthday of Imam Hussein – September 15, 1984. The center has since been serving the community through a wide array of educational programs, events, and activities through the inspiration of the religion of Islam. SIIJLA initiated its humble beginnings with approximately 10-15 families. SIIJLA now has a vibrant community of approximately 70-80 families.
