### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Bayan Islamic Graduate School was founded in 2011 at the Claremont School of Theology, a world-renowned seminary that sought to “desegregate” theological education and enable its students to learn about multiple faith traditions in an authentic manner. The need for a partner to provide graduate-level Islamic Studies led to the formation of Bayan and its incubation towards eventually becoming a free-standing institution. The support of the Islamic Center of Southern California, where the founder and president of Bayan, Dr. Jihad Turk, served as the Imam and Religious Director, helped launch Bayan. Today, Bayan partners with the Chicago Theological Seminary to continue its open structure of collaborative education so Bayan students learn within a multi-religious, multi-ethnic, graduate institution that values diversity. Bayan's degree programs, certificates, and courses are open to students of all backgrounds. As of May 2023, Bayan now has 82 alumni, including imams, chaplains, educators and other community workers.
