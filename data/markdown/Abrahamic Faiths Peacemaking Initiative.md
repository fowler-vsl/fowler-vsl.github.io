### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Formed in 1991 in response to the nuclear arms race, the Abrahamic Faiths Peacemaking Initiative is a group of American clergy and religious activists who advocate peacemaking as an essential and defining mandate of our three faith traditions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The founders were Rector George Regas (All Saints Church Pasadena), Rabbi Leonard Beerman (Leo Baeck Temple) and Dr. Maher Hathout (Islamic Center of Southern California) and they held dozens of educational events and press conferences to raise awareness and call for moral action by people of faith. By bringing together a collection of each faith’s relevant teachings, they brought multi-faith congregations together to contribute an authentic and substantive religious voice to the peace movement, to activate Americans of faith to insist on peaceful solutions to local, national and global conflicts, and in particular to end the war and U.S. occupation in Iraq.
