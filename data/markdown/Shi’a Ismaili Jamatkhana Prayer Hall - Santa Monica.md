### Description Blurb {.description_blurb}
Ismaili Muslims are a culturally diverse community living in over 25 countries around the world. Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims, generally known as the Ismailis, belong to the Shia branch of Islam. The Shia form one of the two major interpretations of Islam, the Sunni being the other. The Ismailis live in over 25 different countries, mainly in Central and South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia, and number approximately 12 to 15 million. Throughout their 1,400 year history, the Ismailis have been led by a living, hereditary Imam. They trace the line of Imamat in hereditary succession from Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad. In time, the Shia were sub-divided. The Ismailis gave their allegiance to Imam Jafar as-Sadiq’s eldest son Ismail, from whom they derive their name. “The Ismailis are the only Shia Muslims to have a living, hereditary Imam; it is the presence of the living Imam that makes the community unique,” according to their website. Here in L.A. the Northridge jamatkhana is one of three Ismaili Centers. The local community operates as part of the international Ismaili community, with a well-defined institutional framework through which they have established schools, hospitals, health clinics, housing, social and economic development activities and programs for the benefit of all. Since 2003, the L.A. County Ismaili community has organized an annual Partnership Walk starting at the Santa Monica Pier. (Source: )
